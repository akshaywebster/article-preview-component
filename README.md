## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

My major learning from this project is to plan ahead for various scenarios. I started with mobile first approach in mind, so I structured my HTML elements accordingly, but later on when I came to write media queries for the desktop version, I realized that I should have used Grid, as it would have been much easier to transform the layout. Also, since I structured my HTML according to mobile-first approach, I had to do some restructuring as well to make the Flexbox layout work.
